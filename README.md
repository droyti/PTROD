  ## Installation - Firefox
  
  <div align="left">

  ## Installation - Chrome
  
  <div align="left">
    
  Chrome installation is slightly more complicated. Chrome requires all packaged extensions to be on the Chrome Web Store for installation, so we'll need to install an unpackaged version.
  
  * Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/droyti/ptrod/releases) and download the `CHROME` `.zip` file under Assets.
  * Extract this file's contents to any safe location where they won't be deleted.
  * Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
  * In the upper right corner, enable Developer Mode.
  * Click the newly created `Load Unpacked` button in the upper left corner.
  * Navigate to and select the directory you unpacked the archive to.
  
  The extension should now be installed! Optionally, you can disable Developer Mode after completing these steps.

  # Usage
  
  This extension will search every YouTube watch page for a dislike button, and, if it hasn't been already, click it. This all happens in the background with no inconvenience to the user.
  
  # But Why?
  
  YouTube [recently announced](https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1458482029817860096) that they'd be removing the public dislike count from videos. Despite massive amounts of negative community feedback, and even [meetings with large creators](https://twitter.com/linusgsebastian/status/1464627802985037831), they have decided to move ahead with this change.
  
  I built this extension after seeing a suggestion for it in a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/r3hifl/according_to_linus_sebastian_ltt_youtube_ignored/hmby9iw/?context=10000). This was created in the hopes of spurring more discussion on the topic, and keeping the legacy of the dislike button alive!
